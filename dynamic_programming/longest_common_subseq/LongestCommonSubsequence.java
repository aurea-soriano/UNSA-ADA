Considering the above implementation, following is a partial recursion tree for
input strings “AXYT” and “AYZX”

                         lcs("AXYT", "AYZX")
                       /
         lcs("AXY", "AYZX")            lcs("AXYT", "AYZ")

lcs("AX", "AYZX") lcs("AXY", "AYZ")   lcs("AXY", "AYZ") lcs("AXYT", "AY")
In the above partial recursion tree, lcs(“AXY”, “AYZ”) is being solved twice.
If we draw the complete recursion tree, then we can see that there are many
subproblems which are solved again and again. So this problem has
 Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems
 can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation. Following is
 a tabulated implementation for the LCS problem.*/
